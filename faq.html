                    <h3>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars?</h3>
                    <p>The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel west? Why did Marco Polo head east?
                        Because it is that pull, that unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans to seek
                        new frontiers to explore.</p>
                    <p>Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure. Imagine living on another planet,
                        millions of miles from the Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of the
                        'stars' is actually the planet you were born on. Who can even envision the incredible feeling of
                        being the first human in history to step out of the capsule and leave your footprint on the
                        surface of Mars? By this we implore you to not just think of that feeling for the astronaut, but
                        the experience for all those watching back home. Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on the
                        Moon all those years ago still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were with and
                        how they felt. The moment the first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to remember.</p>
                    <p>A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars come from? Can it teach us
                        about Earth's history? Is there life on Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of burning
                        questions for scientists all over the world.</p>

                        <h3>What to do there?</h3>
                        <p>During the working hours, the astronauts will be busy performing three main tasks:
                            construction,
                            maintenance and research. Besides work, they will also have time to relax.</p>

                    <h3>Is this trip risky</h3>
                    <p>The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in any means of travel, there
                        are always things that could go wrong. In the case of Mars One, the following risks are
                        conceivable:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accident(s) during launch</li>
                        <li>Vital components could malfunction</li>
                        <li>There could be problems when landing</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you were to compare our mission to
                        the first Moon mission in 1969, it quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.</p>

                        <h3>How long does it take to travel to Mars?</h3>
                        <p>The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts currently stay on the
                            International Space Station.</p>
                        <p>When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time for the astronauts is very
                            important.</p>
                        <p>The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is taken. Because both Mars and
                            Earth's orbits are not perfectly circular, the time it takes to travel between them varies
                            from six to eight months.</p>
